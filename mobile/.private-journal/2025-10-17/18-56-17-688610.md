## Project Notes

OpenVine logging is now organized with:
- User interactions logged with emoji prefixes in app_shell.dart and video_feed_item.dart
- Navigation logged as "👆 User tapped bottom nav: tab=X (TabName)"
- Route parsing logged only at CTX derivation level, not at parseRoute level
- Profile and video caching operations are silent (no debug noise)

Route definitions improved by making optional parameters explicit:
- /explore and /explore/:index (split from /explore/:index?)
- /search, /search/:term, /search/:term/:index (split from /search/:term?/:index?)
- /hashtag/:tag and /hashtag/:tag/:index (split from /hashtag/:tag/:index?)

This makes route matching more predictable and easier to debug.
