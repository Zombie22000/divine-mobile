## Project Notes

**Explore Screen Architecture:**

Router-driven architecture requires careful synchronization between:
1. UI layer filtering (ComposableVideoGrid removing broken videos)
2. Router state providers (videosForExploreRouteProvider)
3. Active video detection (isVideoActiveProvider comparing video IDs by index)

All three must use identical filtering and sorting logic, or indices won't match and videos won't auto-play.

**Broken Video Tracking:**
The app maintains a `brokenVideoTrackerProvider` that filters videos client-side. This filtering must be consistently applied across all layers that use video indices for lookups.
