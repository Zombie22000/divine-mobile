## Project Notes

OpenVine routing architecture learned:
- GoRouter 16.2.4 with ShellRoute for tab preservation
- Optional route parameters require separate sibling routes with shared ValueKey (NOT `:param?` syntax)
- ShellRoute routes are siblings at same level, not nested
- Navigation between siblings requires explicit `context.go()`, not `context.pop()`
- Each tab has its own Navigator key (_homeKey, _exploreKey, _hashtagKey, etc.)
- buildRoute() function in route_utils.dart handles URL construction from RouteContext
- pageContextProvider gives current RouteContext for determining navigation logic
