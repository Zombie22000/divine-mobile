## Project Notes

Drafts feature architecture:
- DraftStorageService uses SharedPreferences for persistence
- VineDraftsScreen is now properly connected via draftStorageServiceProvider
- Drafts accessible from:
  1. Profile screen (existing - line 698 of ProfileScreenRouter)
  2. Camera screen (new - added to UniversalCameraScreenPure AppBar)

Camera screen drafts button:
- Location: lib/screens/pure/universal_camera_screen_pure.dart
- Uses Consumer to conditionally render based on recording state
- Hidden during recording, visible otherwise
- Test file: test/screens/camera_drafts_button_test.dart
