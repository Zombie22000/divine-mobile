## Project Notes

**Router-Driven Architecture Pattern:**

For video feed screens to work with router-driven active video detection:

1. Create a route-aware provider (e.g., `videosForExploreRouteProvider`)
2. Provider must apply ALL client-side filtering (broken videos, sorting, etc.)
3. UI screens WATCH the provider (don't pass lists as parameters)
4. Active video detection also watches the SAME provider
5. Result: Perfect index synchronization

**Anti-Pattern:**
Passing video lists as widget parameters in router-driven architecture. This creates separate state that diverges from the router's state.
