## Project Notes

Draft System Now Fully Functional

The draft system has two access points:
1. VineDraftsScreen - Accessible from profile screen "Drafts" button (only on own profile)
2. VinePreviewScreenPure - Has "Save Draft" button to create drafts

Drafts are persisted to SharedPreferences via DraftStorageService and include:
- Video file path
- Title, description, hashtags
- Frame count, selected approach
- Creation/modification timestamps

Still missing: Drafts button from camera/record screen. User asked if we should add this access point.
