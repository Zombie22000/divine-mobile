## Project Notes

Added comprehensive analytics to OpenVine mobile app to track performance bottlenecks and user issues.

**Critical tracking for reported issues:**
- Popular Now/Trending tabs now track: load start time, first videos received, total load time, empty results, errors, and slow loading (>5s)
- Hashtag feeds will track similar metrics when implemented
- All feed errors are logged with full context (error type, message, load time)

**New analytics events sent to Firebase:**
- screen_load, screen_data_loaded, screen_time, screen_navigation
- feed_first_videos, feed_load_complete, feed_empty, feed_error, feed_scroll_depth
- relay_connection, subscription_first_event, event_publish
- camera_init, recording_stopped, upload_complete
- app_error, feed_load_error, operation_timeout, slow_operation

**Files created:**
- lib/services/screen_analytics_service.dart
- lib/services/feed_performance_tracker.dart
- lib/services/nostr_performance_tracker.dart
- lib/services/camera_metrics_tracker.dart
- lib/services/error_analytics_tracker.dart

**Files modified:**
- lib/screens/explore_screen.dart - Added comprehensive tracking to Popular Now and Trending tabs

This should give us full visibility into where users are experiencing issues with feed loading, especially the "no events" or "slow loading" problems on Popular/Trending/Hashtags.
