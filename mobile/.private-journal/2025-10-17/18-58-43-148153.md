## Project Notes

Successfully fixed web compilation for OpenVine mobile app. The app now compiles and runs on Chrome successfully. The fix involved:

1. Embedded relay database_helper.dart conditional import fixes
2. Removed direct dart:io import that breaks web
3. Web platform now uses in-memory SQLite database
4. Proper platform detection order (web check before test mode)

Note: Accidentally committed large Tor implementation alongside the web fix (6334 files). In future, should check `git status` more carefully before staging files in submodules with pending work.

App is now running cleanly on Chrome with no compilation errors.
