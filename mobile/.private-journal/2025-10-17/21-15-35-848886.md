## Project Notes

Home feed video loading issue resolved:

**Symptoms**:
- Home feed showed "0 videos from following" 
- Error logs: "QUERY-LOCAL Error querying events"
- Error logs: "EXTERNAL-EVENT Failed to store event"  
- Type error: `'() => List<dynamic>' is not a subtype of type '(() => List<String>)?'`

**Root Cause**:
Recent commit ab81b36 added replaceable event handling but introduced a type error in the `orElse` parameter when searching for d-tags.

**Files Changed**:
- lib/services/nostr_service.dart:374 - Fixed orElse to return `<String>[]` instead of `[]`

**Verification**:
- Flutter analyze: no errors
- App now successfully receiving and storing video events
- Explore screen loading videos correctly
