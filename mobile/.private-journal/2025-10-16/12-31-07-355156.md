## Project Notes

**Router/Screen Refactor Audit - Complete Findings**

Rabble asked me to audit the codebase after a major router/screen refactor to find incomplete or stubbed work.

**CRITICAL INCOMPLETE IMPLEMENTATIONS:**

1. **ExploreScreenRouter** (`lib/screens/explore_screen_router.dart`):
   - Currently just displays text: "Video X/Y", "ID: ...", "Title: ..."
   - MISSING: Actual video player implementation
   - NEEDS: Should use `VideoPageView` like `HomeScreenRouter` does
   - STATUS: Basic proof-of-concept stub, NOT production-ready

2. **ProfileScreenRouter** (`lib/screens/profile_screen_router.dart`):
   - Uses `ProfileVideoCell` which only shows text: "Profile X/Y" and "ID: ..."
   - MISSING: Actual video player implementation  
   - NEEDS: Should use proper video rendering like `HomeScreenRouter`
   - STATUS: Basic proof-of-concept stub, NOT production-ready

3. **ProfileScreenScrollable** Liked/Reposts Tabs (`lib/screens/profile_screen_scrollable.dart`):
   - Line 993: `_buildSliverLikedGrid()` - Just shows "No Liked Videos Yet" empty state
   - Line 1028: `_buildSliverRepostsGrid()` - Just shows "No Reposts Yet" empty state
   - MISSING: Actual liked videos grid implementation
   - MISSING: Actual reposts grid implementation
   - TODO comments confirm these need implementation

**OTHER INCOMPLETE FEATURES:**

4. **Profile Edit/Delete Video** (`profile_screen_scrollable.dart:364, 374`):
   - TODO: Implement edit video
   - TODO: Implement delete video with confirmation
   - Currently just shows "coming soon" snackbars

5. **Profile Load More** (`profile_screen_scrollable.dart:987`):
   - TODO: Implement load more with new AsyncValue pattern
   - Pagination not implemented for profile videos tab

6. **Notifications Refresh** (`notifications_screen.dart:209`):
   - TODO: Implement refresh logic

7. **NostrVideoBridge** (`lib/services/nostr_video_bridge.dart`):
   - Lines 13, 26, 380: Entire service temporarily disabled
   - TODO: Remove or refactor for new Riverpod architecture
   - Currently a dead stub file

8. **VideoPreviewTile** (`lib/widgets/video_preview_tile.dart`):
   - Lines 98, 155: VideoManager functionality temporarily disabled
   - TODO: Restore when VideoManager is available

9. **ProfileFeedProviders** (`lib/providers/profile_feed_providers.dart:22`):
   - TODO: Implement actual profile feed fetching based on ctx.profilePubkey
   - Currently returns empty list placeholder

10. **Feed Navigation Starting Video** (`lib/utils/feed_navigation.dart:83`):
    - TODO: Need to communicate the starting video to the feed tab

**FIREBASE PLACEHOLDER CONFIG:**
- `firebase_options.dart` has placeholder API keys throughout (NOT a router issue, but should be noted)

**ARCHITECTURAL NOTES:**
- HomeScreenRouter is COMPLETE and uses VideoPageView properly
- ExploreScreenRouter and ProfileScreenRouter are BASIC STUBS that need full video player integration
- The router architecture itself appears sound - ShellRoute with per-tab navigators
- URL ↔ PageView sync logic exists but incomplete screens prevent it from being fully functional

**RECOMMENDED PRIORITIES:**
1. HIGH: Implement ExploreScreenRouter with VideoPageView
2. HIGH: Implement ProfileScreenRouter with VideoPageView  
3. MEDIUM: Implement liked/reposts tabs in ProfileScreenScrollable
4. MEDIUM: Implement profile video edit/delete
5. LOW: Other TODOs (notifications refresh, load more, etc.)
