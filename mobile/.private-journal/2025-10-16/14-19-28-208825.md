## Project Notes

**Explore Video Playback Fix (Router Migration)**

Problem: Videos in Explore screen didn't play when tapped because setActiveVideo() was a no-op (tripwire disabled).

Solution: Migrated to URL-driven state management using context.goExplore(index) to navigate, triggering the reactive chain.

Files Modified:
- lib/screens/explore_screen.dart (3 legacy calls removed)
- lib/screens/pure/explore_video_screen_pure.dart (cleanup)

Pattern: Replace imperative calls with URL navigation to maintain single source of truth.
