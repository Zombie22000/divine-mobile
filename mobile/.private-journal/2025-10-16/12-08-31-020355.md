## Project Notes

**OpenVine Initialization Architecture**

CURRENT STATE (after fix):
1. DivineApp (ConsumerStatefulWidget) renders immediately
2. DivineApp.initState() schedules _initializeServices() via addPostFrameCallback
3. _initializeServices() calls nostrService.initialize() and other critical services
4. MaterialApp.router renders, showing screens
5. Gate providers watch nostrReadyProvider, appForegroundProvider
6. When gates flip true, VideoEvents provider starts subscription via ref.listen
7. Content loads

ABANDONED PATTERN: AppInitializer widget exists (lines 378-891) but is never rendered. It has comprehensive initialization logic but is bypassed by router architecture.

TODO COMMENT at line 881: "Router handles navigation now, AppInitializer just signals ready" - This comment was misleading because AppInitializer never signaled anything since it never rendered.
