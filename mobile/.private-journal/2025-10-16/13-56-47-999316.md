## Project Notes

## Next Steps for Router Migration

**Ready for Manual Testing**
1. Open macOS app (already running)
2. Scroll down in home feed (swipe up)
3. Verify in logs:
   - _onPageChanged(1) fires
   - context.go('/home/1') called
   - Old video pauses
   - New video plays

**Remaining Migration Work**
After scroll behavior verified, need to migrate 20+ files still using legacy calls:
- explore_screen.dart (3 calls)
- profile_screen_scrollable.dart (3 calls)
- explore_video_screen_pure.dart (1 call)
- video_overlay_manager_provider.dart (9 calls)
- tab_visibility_provider.dart (1 call)
- video_stop_navigator_observer.dart (1 call)
- camera_fab.dart (1 call)

**After Full Migration**
1. Re-enable tripwire (change no-ops to throw assertions)
2. Test all screens to catch any remaining legacy usage
3. Delete activeVideoProvider StateNotifier entirely
4. Clean up deprecated code
5. Add widget tests for reactive behavior
