## Project Notes

Search screen bug fixes (complete solution):

**Problem 1: Blank black screen**
- SearchScreenPure embedded mode returned Column without background color
- Transparent Column was invisible on black Scaffold background
- Fix: Wrapped Column in Container with VineTheme.backgroundColor (line 310)

**Problem 2: GlobalKey conflict causing rendering failures**
- All three search routes (/search, /search/:term, /search/:term/:index) used same _searchKey
- When navigating between routes, Flutter tried to use same GlobalKey for multiple Navigator instances
- Error: "Multiple widgets used the same GlobalKey"
- Fix: Created separate keys for each route:
  - _searchEmptyKey for /search
  - _searchGridKey for /search/:searchTerm  
  - _searchFeedKey for /search/:searchTerm/:index

**Files modified**:
- lib/screens/pure/search_screen_pure.dart (added Container wrapper)
- lib/router/app_router.dart (split GlobalKeys, updated routes)

**Tests**: All tests pass, flutter analyze clean
