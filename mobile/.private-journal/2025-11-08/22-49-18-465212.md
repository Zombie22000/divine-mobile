## Project Notes

Aspect Ratio Feature - Post-Implementation Fixes:

**Issues found in testing:**
1. Preview layout offset (vertical preview in lower-right)
2. Recording failure with widget wrappers (AVFoundation -11805)
3. Minimum segment duration too restrictive for stop-motion

**Commits after initial feature:**
- a481a71: Use Positioned.fill for preview layout
- d324721: Reduce minSegmentDuration to 33ms for stop-motion

**Testing notes:**
- macOS camera recording is sensitive to widget structure
- Preview must be directly in Stack or wrapped only with Positioned.fill
- Avoid FittedBox, SizedBox.expand, OverflowBox around camera preview widgets
