## Project Notes

Search screen blank screen bug fix:
- Issue: SearchScreenPure with embedded=true was rendering a Column without a background color
- The Column was transparent, so on AppShell's black Scaffold background, nothing was visible
- Fix: Wrapped the Column in a Container with VineTheme.backgroundColor
- Tests pass, flutter analyze clean
- Change: lib/screens/pure/search_screen_pure.dart line 310-326

The embedded mode is used because SearchScreenPure is rendered inside AppShell which provides the AppBar and bottom nav. If we used embedded=false, we'd get double AppBars.
