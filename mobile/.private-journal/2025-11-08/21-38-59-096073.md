## Project Notes

**Search Screen Fixes - Nov 8, 2025**

Fixed two issues reported by user:

1. Loading indicator not visible
   - Moved CircularProgressIndicator from suffixIcon to prefixIcon
   - Now replaces search icon (left side) while loading
   - Much more prominent visual feedback

2. Search not reactive to typing
   - Removed URL navigation on every keystroke
   - Widget now stays alive during text input
   - Search updates smoothly as user types without rebuilds

Architecture insight: Search uses hybrid approach:
- Phase 1: Instant local cache search (videoEventsProvider)
- Phase 2: Remote relay search via NIP-50
- Results merged and updated progressively

URL structure:
- `/search` - empty search, keyboard focused
- `/search/:term` - grid view with results
- `/search/:term/:index` - feed view with video playing
