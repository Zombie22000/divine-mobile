## Project Notes

Search screen user profile fix:

**Issue**: User search results were showing raw hex IDs instead of display names
- Example: "@a3828044ffc75bae7820bf69d59bea6f6d9ce8d61ab5e0c2770e00939066cd1f..."

**Root cause**: 
- SearchScreenPure only checked profile cache (getCachedProfile)
- Did not actively fetch profiles for users in search results
- Fell back to showing raw pubkey when profile wasn't cached

**Solution**:
1. Replaced manual Card/ListTile with UserProfileTile widget
2. UserProfileTile uses FutureBuilder to fetch profiles automatically
3. Added sorting: users with display names appear first, unnamed users at end
4. Removed follow button from search results (showFollowButton: false)

**Files modified**:
- lib/screens/pure/search_screen_pure.dart (lines 16, 444-480)
  - Added import for UserProfileTile
  - Replaced manual list building with UserProfileTile
  - Added smart sorting based on profile availability

**Testing**: Flutter analyze clean, ready for iOS testing
