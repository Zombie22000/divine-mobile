## Project Notes

Completed comprehensive audit of Nostr stream handling across entire codebase. Confirmed that VideoEventService and all other core services already use correct reactive patterns. CommentsProvider was the only place using blocking await for - now fixed. The app architecture is sound for handling Nostr's potentially infinite streams.
