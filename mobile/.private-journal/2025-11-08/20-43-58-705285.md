## Project Notes

Found that home_screen_router_test.dart tests are all failing with pumpAndSettle timeouts. This appears to be a pre-existing issue not caused by my RefreshIndicator semanticsLabel change. The tests were timing out even before I made any changes.

The failure happens because pumpAndSettle is waiting for some animation or async operation to complete but it never does. This is likely related to the router navigation or some provider that's not properly mocked in the test setup.

All tests fail with the same error:
```
pumpAndSettle timed out
```

This is a test infrastructure problem that needs to be fixed separately from the RefreshIndicator semantic label change.
