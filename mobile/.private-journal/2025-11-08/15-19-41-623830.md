## Project Notes

**Age-Gating Implementation Status**

**DISCOVERY**: We have ModerationLabelService and ReportAggregationService fully implemented but NEVER initialized or used!

**Services Available**:
1. `ModerationLabelService` - Subscribes to NIP-32 kind 1985 label events
   - Has methods: `getLabelsForEvent()`, `hasLabel()`, `getLabelCounts()`
   - Supports subscribeToLabeler(pubkey)
2. `ReportAggregationService` - Aggregates NIP-56 kind 1984 reports
   - Has method: `getReportsForEvent()` returns `ReportAggregation`
   - Checks for "nudity" report type (line 449)
   - Generates `ModerationRecommendation` with actions: blur, hide, block

**Implementation Plan**:
1. Initialize both services in app_providers.dart
2. Create provider for age-restricted content filtering
3. In Explore/Home feed providers:
   - For each video, check:
     a. Does it have NIP-56 "nudity" reports?
     b. Does it have NIP-32 NSFW labels?
   - If yes AND user hasn't verified age → filter out
4. Subscribe to default moderation labeler (OpenVine official)

**Next Steps**: Present plan to Rabble and implement.
