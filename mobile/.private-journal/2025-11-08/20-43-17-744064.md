## Project Notes

Comments screen fix completed - infinite loading issue resolved. The "Classic Vine" message now appears immediately when there are no comments, instead of showing a spinner for 2 minutes. Used reactive stream pattern with Completer to update UI as events arrive while still properly awaiting stream completion for tests.
