## Project Notes

Aspect Ratio Feature - Critical Bug Fix (Commit 756ecd0):

**Issue**: Videos weren't actually being cropped to selected aspect ratio on macOS
**Cause**: macOS single recording mode bypassed FFmpeg crop filter
**Fix**: Added FFmpeg crop to all 3 macOS finishRecording code paths

**Files Modified**:
- lib/services/vine_recording_controller.dart (added ~100 lines of FFmpeg processing)

**Testing Status**:
- Needs user verification that square recordings are now actually square
- Separate intermittent AVFoundation -11805 error still occurring (may need investigation)

**Commits for aspect ratio feature**:
- Initial implementation: 11 commits
- Layout fixes: 3 commits  
- Minimum duration fix: 1 commit
- Critical crop filter fix: 1 commit (756ecd0)
Total: 16 commits
