## Project Notes

**Age-Gating Problem Analysis**:

User reports age-restricted videos showing in Explore feed with broken thumbnails.

**Current System**:
- `AgeVerificationService` tracks if user verified they're 18+ (`isAdultContentVerified`)
- `MediaAuthInterceptor` handles 401 errors from Blossom servers when loading age-restricted thumbnails
- Blossom returns `{"category":"nudity","status":401}` for NSFW content
- Videos appear in feed → thumbnails try to load → 401 → broken placeholder shows

**The Real Problem**:
Age-restricted videos are visible in the Explore feed grid BEFORE we try loading thumbnails. By the time we discover the content is age-restricted (via 401 response), the video tile is already showing with a broken thumbnail.

**What We Need**:
Filter age-restricted videos OUT of Explore feed UNLESS `AgeVerificationService.isAdultContentVerified == true`.

**Open Questions**:
1. How do we identify age-restricted videos BEFORE trying to load thumbnails?
2. Does Nostr event have a `content-warning` tag we can check?
3. Or do we need to track which videos return 401 and filter them?
4. Should we filter at the provider level or the service level?

Next: Check if VideoEvent has content-warning tag support.
