## Project Notes

Search screen architecture:
- AppShell provides AppBar with "Search" title and back button
- SearchScreenPure rendered with embedded=true (no scaffold, just content)
- Has three tabs: Videos, Users, Hashtags
- Should show empty state with search icon when no query
- Red question mark in screenshot suggests an error state or missing asset

Need to reproduce this on macOS build to see logs and understand root cause.
