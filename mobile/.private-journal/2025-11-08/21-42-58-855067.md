## Project Notes

Task 1 Complete: Camera Switch Button Visibility

Successfully implemented conditional rendering of camera switch button based on canSwitchCamera property.

Key changes:
1. Added `canSwitchCamera: bool` field to VineRecordingUIState class
2. Updated all related methods (constructor, copyWith, updateState) to include canSwitchCamera
3. Modified UniversalCameraScreenPure to conditionally render switch button with `if (recordingState.canSwitchCamera)`
4. Created comprehensive unit tests for the new field
5. Fixed existing tests that needed the new required parameter

Architecture notes:
- VineRecordingController already had canSwitchCamera getter implemented
- The property flows: VineRecordingController -> VineRecordingNotifier -> VineRecordingUIState -> UI
- UI uses conditional rendering pattern: `if (condition) Widget(...)` for clean null-safety

Testing approach:
- Initially tried widget testing but ran into mock complexity
- Pivoted to simpler unit tests for VineRecordingUIState properties
- This was more appropriate and easier to maintain
- All tests pass (4 new tests + fixed 13 existing tests)
