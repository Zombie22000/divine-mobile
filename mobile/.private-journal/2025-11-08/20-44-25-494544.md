## Project Notes

Successfully updated RefreshIndicator semantic labels across the app:

1. **home_screen_router.dart**: Added `semanticsLabel: 'searching for more videos'` to the home feed RefreshIndicator
2. **notifications_screen.dart**: Added `semanticsLabel: 'checking for new notifications'` (context-appropriate label)

Added test in home_screen_router_test.dart to verify the semantic label is set correctly. Note that all tests in this file are currently failing with pumpAndSettle timeouts - this is a pre-existing test infrastructure issue not related to my changes.

Flutter analyze shows 200 pre-existing issues (mostly warnings) but no new issues introduced by my changes.

The RefreshIndicator semantic label is what screen readers will announce when users pull to refresh, improving accessibility.
