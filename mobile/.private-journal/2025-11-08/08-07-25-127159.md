## Project Notes

Navigation architecture insight: The router-driven design is solid, but tab navigation UX needs careful thought. The `LastTabPositionProvider` is great for video feeds where you want to resume where you left off (Home feed), but wrong for discovery tabs (Explore) where users expect to start fresh each time.

Pattern: When tapping bottom nav tabs, distinguish between:
- **Resume tabs** (Home, Notifications): Restore last position for continuity
- **Discovery tabs** (Explore): Reset to primary view for fresh exploration

This explains why the fix was to hardcode `null` for Explore but keep `lastIndex` for Home/Notifications.
