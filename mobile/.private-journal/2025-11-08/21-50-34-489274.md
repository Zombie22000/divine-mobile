## Project Notes

Task 3 of aspect ratio selection feature had scope creep - included canSwitchCamera UI feature and ProofManifest JSON serialization alongside the planned FFmpeg crop filter changes. Rabble opted to accept it and move forward (Option 1) rather than rewrite commits. The core FFmpeg functionality is correct and all 6 integration tests pass. Additional features don't break anything, just make the commit larger than planned.
