## Project Notes

Search screen mystery on iOS:
- Screenshot shows "Search" title but Explore tab highlighted in bottom nav (should be Home or hidden)
- Red question mark on black background - not in any code I can find
- SearchScreenPure code looks correct - dark theme, proper widget structure
- Could be a routing bug, asset loading issue, or iOS-specific rendering problem
- Unable to reproduce on iOS simulator due to Xcode version mismatch (looking for iOS 26.1 which doesn't exist)

Need user to provide:
1. Exact navigation steps to reproduce
2. Whether issue is consistent
3. Any console logs from the device
