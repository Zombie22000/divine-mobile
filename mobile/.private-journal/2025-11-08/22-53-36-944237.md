## Project Notes

**Bug Fix Update: Corrected threshold for 6.3 second max videos**

**Initial mistake**: Used `remainingDuration.inSeconds <= 1` which was WAY too loose for 6.3s max videos.

**Problem**: With 6.3s max, if user manually stopped at 5.5s (remaining: 0.8s), or 6.2s (remaining: 0.3s), both would show `.inSeconds = 0` and trigger the false warning.

**Corrected fix**: Changed to `remainingDuration.inMilliseconds < 50`
- This catches true max-time stops (0ms remaining) 
- But NOT manual stops (which will have > 50ms remaining)
- 50ms threshold provides margin for timer precision

**Test cases with 6.3s max**:
- Single frame (33ms): remaining = 6267ms → Don't show ✓
- 1s segment: remaining = 5300ms → Don't show ✓
- 6.2s segment: remaining = 100ms → Don't show ✓
- Auto-stop at 6.3s: remaining = ~0ms → Show message ✓

**Lesson learned**: Always verify assumptions about constants (max duration, thresholds) - don't assume Vine-like apps use 60 second limits!
