## Project Notes

ProofMode integration data flow:
1. VineDraft stores proofManifestJson (String)
2. VineDraft.proofManifest getter deserializes JSON → ProofManifest object
3. Metadata screen passes ProofManifest to uploadManager.startUpload()
4. UploadManager serializes back to JSON for PendingUpload storage
5. VideoEventPublisher checks upload.hasProofMode and deserializes to add tags

Critical bug: Tag names in video_event_publisher.dart didn't match expected format. Must use:
- 'proof-verification-level' (not 'verification')
- 'proof-device-attestation' (not 'device_attestation')  
- 'proof-pgp-fingerprint' (not 'pgp_fingerprint')
- 'proofmode' (this one was correct)
