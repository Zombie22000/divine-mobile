## Project Notes

## AI Content Reporting - Service Initialization Failure

**Issue**: Quick AI report button fails with "Reporting service not initialized"

**Error Details**:
- Button successfully created in share_video_menu.dart
- `_quickReportAI()` method implemented
- When tapped, shows error: "Failed to report content: Reporting service not initialized"
- Using: `await ref.read(contentReportingServiceProvider.future)`

**Root Cause Investigation Needed**:
1. Check if ContentReportingService constructor requires dependencies that aren't available
2. Verify contentReportingServiceProvider is properly defined in app_providers
3. Check if service needs explicit initialization in app startup
4. Look for similar working services (like ContentDeletionService) to compare patterns

**TDD Approach**:
1. Write test that reproduces the initialization failure
2. Investigate service dependencies
3. Fix initialization issue
4. Verify test passes
5. Test in running app

**Files Modified So Far**:
- lib/services/content_moderation_service.dart (added aiGenerated enum + switch case)
- lib/services/content_reporting_service.dart (added switch case for aiGenerated)
- lib/widgets/share_video_menu.dart (added button UI + _quickReportAI method)

**Next Steps**: 
- Read ContentReportingService class to understand initialization requirements
- Check how similar async services (ContentDeletionService) are initialized
- Write failing test for service initialization
- Fix the root cause
