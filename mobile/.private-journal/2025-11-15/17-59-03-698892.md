## Project Notes

Fixed excessive video logging spam that was logging state changes every 100ms. Made two changes: (1) in individual_video_providers.dart, changed the listener to only log when significant state changes occur (initialization, buffering, errors), not on every position update; (2) in video_feed_item.dart, removed the "SHOWING VIDEO PLAYER" log that fired on every frame rebuild. This reduces console spam from hundreds of lines per second to only important events.
