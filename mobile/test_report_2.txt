[14:29:00.902]    - Has a delay in indexing
[14:29:00.902]    - Has storage/filtering issues

[2025-09-09T14:29:20.629292] INFO: Initializing Flutter Embedded Nostr Relay
[14:29:20.639] Embedded relay retry failed: Binding has not yet been initialized.
The "instance" getter on the ServicesBinding binding mixin is only available once that binding has been initialized.
Typically, this is done by calling "WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()" or "runApp()" (the latter calls the former). Typically this call is done in the "void main()" method. The "ensureInitialized" method is idempotent; calling it multiple times is not harmful. After calling that method, the "instance" getter will return the binding.
In a test, one can call "TestWidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()" as the first line in the test's "main()" method to initialize the binding.
If ServicesBinding is a custom binding mixin, there must also be a custom binding class, like WidgetsFlutterBinding, but that mixes in the selected binding, and that is the class that must be constructed before using the "instance" getter.

The "instance" getter on the ServicesBinding binding mixin is only available once that binding has been initialized.
Typically, this is done by calling "WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()" or "runApp()" (the latter calls the former). Typically this call is done in the "void main()" method. The "ensureInitialized" method is idempotent; calling it multiple times is not harmful. After calling that method, the "instance" getter will return the binding.
In a test, one can call "TestWidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()" as the first line in the test's "main()" method to initialize the binding.
If ServicesBinding is a custom binding mixin, there must also be a custom binding class, like WidgetsFlutterBinding, but that mixes in the selected binding, and that is the class that must be constructed before using the "instance" getter.

Warning: At least one test in this suite creates an HttpClient. When running a test suite that uses
TestWidgetsFlutterBinding, all HTTP requests will return status code 400, and no network request
will actually be made. Any test expecting a real network connection and status code will fail.
To test code that needs an HttpClient, provide your own HttpClient implementation to the code under
test, so that your test can consistently provide a testable response to the code under test.

  Binding has not yet been initialized.
  The "instance" getter on the ServicesBinding binding mixin is only available once that binding has been initialized.
  Typically, this is done by calling "WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()" or "runApp()" (the latter calls the former). Typically this call is done in the "void main()" method. The "ensureInitialized" method is idempotent; calling it multiple times is not harmful. After calling that method, the "instance" getter will return the binding.
  In a test, one can call "TestWidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()" as the first line in the test's "main()" method to initialize the binding.
  If ServicesBinding is a custom binding mixin, there must also be a custom binding class, like WidgetsFlutterBinding, but that mixes in the selected binding, and that is the class that must be constructed before using the "instance" getter.

  Bad state: A test tried to use `any` or `captureAny` on a parameter of type `BaseRequest`, but
  registerFallbackValue was not previously called to register a fallback value for `BaseRequest`.
  
  To fix, do:
  
  ```
  void main() {
    setUpAll(() {
      registerFallbackValue(/* create a dummy instance of `BaseRequest` */);
    });
  }
  ```
  
  This instance of `BaseRequest` will only be passed around, but never be interacted with.
  Therefore, if `BaseRequest` is a function, it does not have to return a valid object and
  could throw unconditionally.
  If you cannot easily create an instance of `BaseRequest`, consider defining a `Fake`:
  
  ```
  class MyTypeFake extends Fake implements MyType {}
  
  void main() {
    setUpAll(() {
      registerFallbackValue(MyTypeFake());
    });
  }
  ```
  
  Fallbacks are required because mocktail has to know of a valid `BaseRequest` to prevent
  TypeErrors from being thrown in Dart's sound null safe mode, while still
  providing a convenient syntax.

  registerFallbackValue was not previously called to register a fallback value for `BaseRequest`.

  If you cannot easily create an instance of `BaseRequest`, consider defining a `Fake`:
  
  ```
  class MyTypeFake extends Fake implements MyType {}
  
  void main() {
    setUpAll(() {
      registerFallbackValue(MyTypeFake());
    });
  }
  ```
  
  Fallbacks are required because mocktail has to know of a valid `BaseRequest` to prevent
  TypeErrors from being thrown in Dart's sound null safe mode, while still
  providing a convenient syntax.

  Bad state: A test tried to use `any` or `captureAny` on a parameter of type `BaseRequest`, but

  This instance of `BaseRequest` will only be passed around, but never be interacted with.

Warning: At least one test in this suite creates an HttpClient. When running a test suite that uses
TestWidgetsFlutterBinding, all HTTP requests will return status code 400, and no network request
will actually be made. Any test expecting a real network connection and status code will fail.
To test code that needs an HttpClient, provide your own HttpClient implementation to the code under
test, so that your test can consistently provide a testable response to the code under test.

[14:31:23.512] [SYSTEM] Failed to load following list from cache: Binding has not yet been initialized.
The "instance" getter on the ServicesBinding binding mixin is only available once that binding has been initialized.
Typically, this is done by calling "WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()" or "runApp()" (the latter calls the former). Typically this call is done in the "void main()" method. The "ensureInitialized" method is idempotent; calling it multiple times is not harmful. After calling that method, the "instance" getter will return the binding.
In a test, one can call "TestWidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()" as the first line in the test's "main()" method to initialize the binding.
If ServicesBinding is a custom binding mixin, there must also be a custom binding class, like WidgetsFlutterBinding, but that mixes in the selected binding, and that is the class that must be constructed before using the "instance" getter.

[14:31:23.591] [SYSTEM] Failed to load following list from cache: Binding has not yet been initialized.
The "instance" getter on the ServicesBinding binding mixin is only available once that binding has been initialized.
Typically, this is done by calling "WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()" or "runApp()" (the latter calls the former). Typically this call is done in the "void main()" method. The "ensureInitialized" method is idempotent; calling it multiple times is not harmful. After calling that method, the "instance" getter will return the binding.
In a test, one can call "TestWidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()" as the first line in the test's "main()" method to initialize the binding.
If ServicesBinding is a custom binding mixin, there must also be a custom binding class, like WidgetsFlutterBinding, but that mixes in the selected binding, and that is the class that must be constructed before using the "instance" getter.
