## Project Notes

Successfully completed app-wide rebranding from "diVine" to "Divine"/"divine". Changed 40+ instances across:

**Production Code**:
- App shell header (mobile/lib/router/app_shell.dart): Home screen title and Pacifico font conditional
- Welcome screen (mobile/lib/screens/welcome_screen.dart): Main title and "What is Divine?" section
- Permission descriptions (mobile/ios/Runner/Info.plist, mobile/macos/Runner/Info.plist): Camera, microphone, Bluetooth usage descriptions
- Widgets: badge_explanation_modal.dart, bug_report_dialog.dart, share_video_menu.dart, blossom_settings_screen.dart, vine_drawer.dart
- Camera screens: universal_camera_screen_pure.dart, vine_recording_controller.dart, enhanced_mobile_camera_interface.dart

**Documentation**:
- CAMERA_ARCHITECTURE.md: Permission description examples
- MODERATION_RESPONSE_PROCESS.md: Policy commitment text, moderation system descriptions, infrastructure references
- APPLE_REVIEW_RESPONSE.md: App description and policy statements

**Tests**:
- welcome_screen_font_test.dart: Test descriptions and assertions
- app_shell_header_test.dart: Header title test
- vine_drawer_test.dart: Logo description in test

**Verification**:
- Ran `flutter analyze` - no new issues introduced (314 pre-existing issues remain)
- Final grep shows no "diVine" instances remaining in production code (only in private journal files which are gitignored)

**Case Convention Applied**:
- User-facing UI text: "Divine" (proper capitalization)
- Sentence context: "divine" (lowercase when grammatically appropriate)
- Never: "diVine" (mixed case) - this was the old branding

The app now consistently uses "Divine" throughout all user-facing text, documentation, and tests.
