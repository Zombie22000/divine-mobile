## Project Notes

Session initialized. Key context:
- App is called "diVine" (trademark concern - avoid "vine" terminology)
- Must refer to content as "videos" not "vines" 
- 6-second looping video app
- Development platform: macOS desktop (not Chrome)
- Release targets: iOS/Android primarily, some Windows/macOS
- Strict TDD required - tests before implementation
- No Future.delayed() or arbitrary timers
- Dark mode only UI
- Embedded Nostr relay architecture (never connect NostrService directly to external relays)
- Never truncate Nostr IDs
- Blossom upload architecture for decentralized media hosting
