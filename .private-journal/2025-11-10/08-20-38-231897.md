## Project Notes

## Checklist Review (Nov 10, 2025)

Rabble asked about 5 checklist items:

1. **PopularNowFeed provider** - ✅ Already implemented but NOT being used
   - Provider exists at `lib/providers/popular_now_feed_provider.dart`
   - Uses VideoFeedBuilder pattern correctly
   - But ExploreScreen still uses old `videoEventsProvider` (discovery feed)
   - Decision needed: Switch to PopularNowFeed or keep current approach?

2. **Update ExploreScreen to use PopularNowFeed** - ❓ Not done, provider not used
   - Currently uses `videoEventsProvider` (discovery subscription)
   - Both New Vines and Popular Vines tabs use same data source
   - Just sorted differently client-side

3. **Fix tab reset navigation** - ❓ Need more context
   - Not sure what specific issue this refers to
   - Current tab reset logic in `_resetToDefaultState()` looks okay

4. **Test video upload** - ❓ Unclear what needs verification
   - Need to know what URL fields specifically

5. **Run all tests** - ⏳ Can do this now

**Key Finding**: Both New Vines and Popular Vines tabs currently share the same data source (`videoEventsProvider`), just sorted differently. PopularNowFeed provider exists but isn't being used. This might be intentional or might be incomplete migration.
